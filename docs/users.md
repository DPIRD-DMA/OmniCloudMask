# Who's Using It?

OmniCloudMask has been adopted by research institutions, government agencies, and industry for cloud and cloud shadow masking across a variety of applications.

## Adoption

As of early 2026, the OmniCloudMask Python package has been downloaded over 170,000 times. The [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2025.114694) (Wright et al., 2025) has been included in the [NASA Select Landsat Publications](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/landsat/publications/) collection.
